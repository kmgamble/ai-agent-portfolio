## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a seasoned product strategist with a passion for expanding into new markets and optimizing pricing strategies. With my PMP certification and background in engineering, I bring a unique blend of technical knowledge and business acumen to AI development.

When I'm not building AI agents, you'll find me writing fantasy and science fiction novels, speaking at PMI Mile Hi Chapter events, or mentoring through the Society of Women Engineers. I believe in using technology to solve real-world problems while keeping the human element at the center of innovation.
