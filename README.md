I'm Krista Gamble, a product strategy professional based in Parker, Colorado, with a passion for leveraging AI to solve everyday challenges. With my PMP certification and experience at Smarsh, I bring a unique perspective to AI agent development - focusing on practical solutions that deliver measurable results.

When I'm not building AI agents, you'll find me speaking at PMI Mile Hi Chapter events, contributing to the Society of Women Engineers, or working on my latest science fiction novel. I believe technology should empower people, and my agents reflect this philosophy.
